# Introduction

The growing degree days (GDD) is a temperature index tool used in agriculture to predict the best planting season for a plant. GDD enhances predicting the best planting time of a crop to its maturity, in terms of high heat accumulated in the ground in regions conducive. GDD is used to predict and compare the growing rate of a plant from germination to yielding and predict future planting.
Mathematically, GDD is calculated using the following equation:

begin{equation}
textrm{GDD} = \left(\frac{T_{max} + T_{min}}{2}\right) - T_{base}
label{eqn:gdd}
end{equation}

Generally, GDD is calculated by adding the maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperature together dividing by two (2) and then subtracting the base temperature (Tbase).
When determining the GDD of a plant, each plant has a conducive temperature for development and so it has a base temperature (Tbase). The base temperature is the lowest temperature a plant can survive in. (Tbase) will be considered 5 $^{\circ}$C for the calculation of GDD in this report.
The reference temperature for a given plant is the temperature below which its development slows or stops. For example, peas are planted during the cold season, where it has a reference temperature of 40  $^{\circ}$F while sweet corn and soybeans are planted during the hot season, where they have a reference temperature of 50 degrees  $^{\circ}$F.
In this report, detailed results of GDD calculations will be presented. The GDD calculations were done for three main cities of Canada in 2016 including Victoria, Ottawa, and Montreal.
